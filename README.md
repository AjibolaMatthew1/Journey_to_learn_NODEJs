# Journey_to_learn_NODEJs


Hello and Welcome to this repository! Glad to have you here.

The purpose of this repository is to document my progress in Learning Javascript.
I am currently being mentored by a friend Ebenezer, who gives me tasks to work on.
This repository would contain my attempts to the tasks he gives me.
