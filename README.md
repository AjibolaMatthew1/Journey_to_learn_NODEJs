# Journey_to_learn_NODEJs

Hello and Welcome to this repository! Glad to have you here. 


The purpose of this repository is to document my progress in Learning Javascript. 
I am currently being mentored by a friend Ebenezer, who gives me tasks to work on. 
This repository would contain my attempts to the tasks he gives me.
