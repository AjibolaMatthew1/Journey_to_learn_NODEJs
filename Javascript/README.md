Welcome to this directory! 

This directory would host my learning on just pure javascript. Note I took Traversy Media's crashcourse on Javascript and also took FreeCodeCamp's.


I plan on  becoming a backend developer in some months time leveraging frameworks like NodeJs and ExpressJs. 

My friend, Ebenezer, is guiding on the journey by giving me tasks!


On my first ever task, which is on Document object Model by the way, I was asked to display the current location of the mouse pointer after it has moved 100px 
in either x or y direction. 

If you have a better way to solve this, kindly let me know! I didn't take DOM seriously though ðŸ™ƒ as I plan to do strictly backend, well for now. 


Thank you!
